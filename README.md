# petHopper
This was a class based pet hopper tamagotchi based thing its not finished but i got this idea after seeing a friends code and when i finesed learning about OOP 

The first thing you will see when you start the program is the game setstat menu which will prompt you to set the age and name of your hopper

once that is done you will be greated with the games main menu

at the menu you can show thing about your hopper

Like its age and whats in its belly because you have to feed your hopper

back to the main menu you can feed your hopper these items will be added to your hoppers belly and slowly deleated after it digests them

if we look at the belly after a while it only has one thing left

your hopper will die if it gets too old.

There was a lot more i was going to do with this game like adding more hoppers making a keeper class, making a store to buy things to keep the hoppers,
mini games to level up your hoppers letting your hoppers get sick and needing to buy meds to heal them, making it so you had to get money to buy items 
etc.
